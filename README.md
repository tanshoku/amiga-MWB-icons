# amiga-MWB-icons
Almost 6000 icons from the Amiga MagicWB, in PNG format. These come originally from [here](https://grimore.org/amiga/standardised_magicwb_icons), but were converted from the original INFO format to a more usable (at least for UNIX, Windows and the likes) PNG format.

For more info about the icons themselves, credits and so on, have a look at the [README.txt](README.txt) file.
